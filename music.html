    <h1>My Music</h1>
    <p>
      My original music is predominately recorded in Garageband, with use of ukulele, guitar, keyboard, drums, and upright bass. 
      I've been lucky to collaborate with amazing artists throughout my time composing that have all brought these projects to life, 
      and I would not be able to fully realize these pieces without them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major inspirations include: They Might Be Giants, Garfunkel and Oates, Anaïs Mitchell, Fiona Apple, Jeanine Tesori, Mitski, Talking Heads, and of course the late great Stephen Sondheim.

      <h3>Variations on a Theme</h3>
      <p>This is my first ever original music project made in 2020. "Variations on a Theme" referring to both the song form and lyrical content of this short EP. A few of these songs would go onto become inspiration for my first musical "The Woman Her Husband and Herself".</p>

      <h3>Impulses and Premeditations</h3>
      <p>Shortly following "Variations on a Theme" I would dive into impulses and premeditations. Adding one more track to the list, this album explores themes of aging, fidelity, and anger. Two more songs for this album would be used for TWHH&HS.</p>

      <h3>Songs of Spring</h3>
      <p>This was the final album project on the way to writing "The Woman, Her Husband and Herself". This has the most tracks that went into the final musical and was also a large jump in style for the album art.</p>

      <h3>The Woman Her Husband and Herself</h3>
      <p>You guessed it! Here is the original cast album for "The Woman, Her Husband, and Herself". This musical was produced in a friend's home in Milwaukee Wisconsin July 2021. Starring Elena Benhke, Chase Gilbertson, and Dan Persino. The musical follows a woman being followed by herself, as her husband tries to help.</p>

      <h3>Songs About Write Now</h3>
      <p>This was my most recent project and my first full length album. After the three previous musical projects being produced by Mona Turks, this was my first self produced project in 5 years. This album combines ukulele, synths, pedals, and upright bass to bring together my emotional narrative of what it feels like to write music. This was also my first album to be available on all streaming platforms.</p>

      <h3>People in My House</h3>
      <p>Produced by Nicholas Boni in his home studio, this is one of the few pieces of music I have felt passionately should not have backup vocals.</p>
